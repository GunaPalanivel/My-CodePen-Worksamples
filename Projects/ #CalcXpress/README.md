#CalcXpress is a simple and interactive calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator features a user-friendly interface with a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes. Users can input mathematical expressions using the provided number buttons and operators, and the calculator displays the result instantly. #CalcXpress is a handy tool for quick calculations on the go. In my last CalcXpress, I forgot to add the backspace key so I updated the code here and I added that feature here.
